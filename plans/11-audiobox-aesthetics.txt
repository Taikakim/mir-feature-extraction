Feature semantics:
Content Enjoyment captures aesthetic appeal and subjective preference. High CE indicates music people want to listen to repeatedly. This is inherently subjective and culturally dependent.
Content Usefulness measures functional value—whether audio serves its intended purpose (e.g., workout music that energizes, background music that doesn't distract). More objective than enjoyment.
Production Complexity quantifies sophistication of production techniques—layering, processing, arrangement density. High PC indicates professional, intricate production; low PC suggests minimal, raw, or DIY approaches.
Production Quality measures technical excellence—clean recording, balanced mix, absence of artifacts. High PQ is quasi-objective—well-mastered tracks score higher regardless of style.
Training strategy note: Use high dropout rate later during training (e.g., 50%) so the model doesn't become overly dependent on these signals. This creates a model that can generate well without these features but improves when they're provided.
