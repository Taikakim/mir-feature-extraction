Stem separation

The separated files can be used whenever it will be beneficial to the purpose of retrieving musical information.

Demucs

    • Separate all input files with demucs-ht v4
        ◦ Paraneters:
            ▪ shifts 1
            ▪ filetype flac
            ▪ number of concurrent jobs 4.
        ◦ Have the relevant Demucs variables however available as parameters to the script.
    • The output folder will be the same where the original file resides in the file structure  defined in “File organisation/ Folder structure”
    • The filenames of the stems will be just drums.FILETYPE etc, so using the previous example we will now have:
        ◦ /folder1/folder2/filename-something/full_mix.flac
        ◦ /folder1/folder2/filename-something/drums.flac
        ◦ /folder1/folder2/filename-something/bass.flac
        ◦ /folder1/folder2/filename-something/other.flac
        ◦ /folder1/folder2/filename-something/vocals.flac
DrumSep

Each drums.FILETYPE will now be further separated by the Drumsep routine to also have
Further percussion tracks named by the percussion type in the same folder than the other files. From these percussion stems later drum-specific MRI can be extracted.
