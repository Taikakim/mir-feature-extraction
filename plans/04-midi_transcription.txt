MIDI Conversion

Save outputs from different algorithms as separate MIDI files. During final implementation I will probably pick just one to use, but during development and testing I want to compare between the models/ methods.

Drum Transcription

Drums algorithm 1: ADTOF : https://github.com/MZehren/ADTOF
Drums algorithm 2: OaF Drums: https://magenta.withgoogle.com/oaf-drums
Drums algorith 3: https://github.com/jarredou/models/releases/tag/aufr33-jarredou_MDX23C_DrumSep_model_v0.1 as described in: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.24853


Use the rhythm Grid established in section “Syncopation/ Establish a Beat Grid” to quantise music where BPM is present as established in step 10.

Bass Transcription

Bass algorithm 1: Basic Pitch: https://github.com/spotify/basic-pitch
Bass algorithm 2: PESTO: https://github.com/SonyCSLParis/pesto
Bass algorithm 3:CREPE: https://github.com/marl/crepe

Where possible, convert continuous pitch to MIDI with pitch bend using a range of 12 semitones.

Save the continuous pitch data for later use.

Polyphonic Transcription for Other stem

Where there is ambiguity over a given note, the harmony information extracted in step 11 could potentially be used in making educated choices.

Other algorithm 1: Basic Pitch
Other algorithm 2: MT3: https://github.com/magenta/mt3
Other algorithm 3: MR-MT3: https://github.com/gudgud96/MR-MT3

Generate MIDI files

    • MIDI files are recorded in the same parent input file folder than the rest of the files, as defined in the section “File organsation/ Folder Structure”
