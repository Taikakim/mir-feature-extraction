Audio Commons subjective features

https://github.com/AudioCommons/timbral_models

With Audio Commons, extract the following features:

    • Brightness
    • Roughness
    • Hardness
    • Depth
    • Booming
    • Reverberation
    • Sharpness
    • Warmth

Feature extraction: Use the Audio Commons Timbral Models library (timbral_models Python package) which implements perceptual models for each attribute. These models were developed through psychoacoustic experiments correlating acoustic features with human perception.
Brightness correlates with spectral centroid—higher values indicate more high-frequency content. Critical for controlling "dark" versus "bright" sonic character.
Roughness relates to beating and modulation, capturing harshness or smoothness. High roughness characterizes distorted guitars, growling bass; low roughness suggests pure tones, smooth pads.
Hardness distinguishes soft, mellow sounds from hard, metallic ones. Correlates with attack sharpness and spectral irregularity.
Depth captures the sense of spaciousness and resonance in low frequencies. High depth suggests large spaces, powerful sub-bass.
Booming specifically measures low-frequency resonance and perceived "boominess" around 100-200 Hz. Critical for controlling bass weight without affecting sub-bass or higher harmonics.
Reverberation quantifies wet/dry balance and decay characteristics. Straightforward perceptual model of reverb amount.
Sharpness measures high-frequency harshness per psychoacoustic models. Related to brightness but specifically captures perceived "sharpness" that can be fatiguing.
Warmth captures the perception of mid-low frequency richness that makes sounds feel "warm" versus "cold"—fundamental for controlling emotional quality.
Why these features matter: Audio Commons descriptors bridge the semantic gap between acoustic features and perceptual qualities. Users can condition on "bright, warm, reverberant" rather than "high spectral centroid, elevated 200-600Hz, long RT60." This makes the model more intuitive while providing orthogonal control dimensions compared to raw spectral features.
